            <h1>Woven Balls</h1>
            <p>Each of these balls is made up of a set of equally sized, slightly deformed rings. The deformations allow the rings to interweave. The number and positions of the rings correspond to one of the spherical symmetry groups.</p>

            <p>To construct such a ball, you can start with a symmetrical polyhedron with equal faces and expand its face planes until they intersect a sphere. The intersections of these planes with the sphere create a set of rings.</p>

            <p>At the intersection points of two rings, one ring is designated as going "above" the other. As you follow along one ring, you alternate intersection points - if at one point this ring lies above another, then at the next one it lies below. Provided that no three rings intersect at one point, this can always be achieved for all rings.</p>

            <p>Depending on the radius of the sphere, each polyhedron can create several weaving patterns. Here, we present balls generated by a cube (6 rings), octahedron (8), rhombidodecahedron (12), dodecahedron (12), icosahedron (20), and rhombitriacontahedron (30).</p>

            <p>For the Platonic solids (excluding the tetrahedron), it's also possible to use planes that pass through the center of the sphere. The number of such planes is half the number of faces of the polyhedron (3 for a cube, 4 for an octahedron, 6 for a dodecahedron, and 10 for an icosahedron). We denote these balls here with the number 0.</p>

            <p>For the other balls, the number represents the distance of the plane of the ring from the center of the sphere, assuming that the radius of the ring is 1.</p>
